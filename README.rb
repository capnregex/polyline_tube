# polygon tube problem

Given two consecutive line segments in a path

find the paths of the line segments that are parallel at a specified distance from the initial line segment 

## given the path


+ `[(2,2), (4,3), (1,6)]`


## The equations for the two lines are 

+ `y = 1/2x + 1`
+ `y = -1x + 7`

## the intersection between the lines is at

+ `(4,3)`

## the intersections between the parallel lines are 

+ `(4.197453049082134,4.2167605132909625)`
+ `(2.3118349659180066,3.273951471708898)`
+ `(5.688165034081994,2.726048528291102)`
+ `(3.8025469509178667,1.7832394867090384)`
